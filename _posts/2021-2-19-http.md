# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

### Why did HTTP come about??

![CERN](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/CERN_%28Film%29.jpg)

The answer is: "Through different network infrastructures" of two CERN locations, one in France and the other in Switzerland. (Side Info: CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a large research facility near Geneva)
To solve this problem, in 1989 a physicist named "Tim Berners-Lee" proposed a project to his employer to simplify the worldwide exchange of information between scientists. This is based on the principle of hypertext (hypertext follows the principle of not being read from cover to cover like a book, but of expanding the content through cross-references

In the following two years, Berners-Lee developed HTML, HTTP, WorldWideWeb (the first web browser), and the first web server, CERN httpd

Thank you!

### What role does HTTP play in this scenario?

The Hyperthext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP for short, is a stateless protocol for the transfer of data on the application layer and uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to build a connection to the server.. uff TCP.. why do i need that? i just want to know what http is..
OK! Imagine a person who is very skilled in organizing and exchanging data. You wrote a process so that you don't have to negotiate a new process every time you exchange data .. that would be inefficient. That process is called HTTP. But at the end of the day, everyone haves to use the same protocoll, otherwise you would get that process which you invest a lot of time in would be worthless if the others dont know. HMM - OK! That makes sense i guess!

But what the hell is TCP? I mean the meaning of the process is clear?!
TCP is kinda the taxi driver which is responsible to bring you or your message to the right address his response back to you..
It builds the connection between client and server.

But why does HTTP does not do this too? D
DUDE! divide and conquer ;) you can't be the best in everything at the same time, so lets split up the work ;-)

If you break it all down, HTTP is basically the language that web browsers and web servers speak.


### Find the correct server for communication

In order to find the right one among the many servers, you have to know its exact name.
In the computer world, URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) are used for this. As the name suggests
the URL locates a resource, for example a website.


### What does a URL consist of?

 ```
 https://examplecat.com:443/cats?color=light%20gray#banana
 \___/   \____________/\__/\___/ \________________/\_____/
   |             |       |   |           |            |
scheme          domain  port |         query       fragment id
                            path
```

* scheme:                 used protocol
* domain:                 Host
* port:                   different services can be called on each port (Defaults 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS)
* path:                   path on the server (which directories to search for executable files)
* query parameters:       are used for different versions of a page
* URL encoding:           "%" comined with hex code '20' --> %20
* fragment id:            is used to jump to an specific HTML id (<a id='banana'>...</a>)

[ASCII TABLE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/ASCII-Table-wide.svg)

'SO! we got the language, the connection and the location of a site!'
'We understood that a browser (client) can build a connection (TCP) with the location (URL) and talk with a Webserver a specific Language (HTTP) - On a abstract level you now can understand what HTTP is good for. Lets move forward to the way how the protocol expects client and server to act'

### Examples

Let's try a curl. curl? ahh did you mean cURL? (Client for URLs / Curl URL Request Library) cURL is a Librarary to transfer data in networks.

```
$ curl -i https://examplecat.com/cat.txt -H "Range:bytes=0-17"
```
result:
```

X-Request-ID is a random ID which is created by the user and pass to the server. The server includes that ID for every following request. This makes debugging easier for developer while walk through the logs.


Anatomy of a http request
```
GET /search?q=proemion HTTP/2       //Method "GET", Path "/search", Protocol "HTTP/2", Query String "q=proemion"
Host: www.bing.com                  //Host "www.bing.com"
User-Agent: curl/7.54.0             //Header (User-Agent tells what application is doing that request)
Accept: */*                         //Header (Accept tells what kind of response is okay, in this case any type)
```
