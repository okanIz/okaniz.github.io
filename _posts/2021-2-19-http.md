The reward of this entry is about giving the reader an idea of what HTTP is doing and hopefully allows him to understand a Request.
  

# Why did HTTP come about?

![CERN](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/CERN_%28Film%29.jpg)

Through different network infrastructures of two CERN locations, one in France and the other in Switzerland the exchange of information was too complicated. (Side Info: CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a large research facility near Geneva)
To solve this problem, in 1989 a physicist named "Tim Berners-Lee" proposed a project to his employer to simplify the worldwide exchange of information between scientists. This is based on the principle of hypertext (hypertext follows the principle of not being read from cover to cover like a book, but of expanding the content through cross-references

In the following two years, Berners-Lee developed HTML, HTTP, WorldWideWeb (the first web browser), and the first web server, CERN HTTPd

Thank you!

### What role does HTTP play in this scenario?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP for short, is a stateless protocol for the transfer of data on the application layer and uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to build a connection to the server.  
My ignorant version: "uff TCP.. why do I need that? I just want to know what HTTP is..."  
My wise version: "Imagine a person who is very skilled in organizing and exchanging data. This person wrote a process so that you don't have to negotiate a new process every time you exchange data, that would be inefficient. That process is called HTTP. But at the end of the day, everyone haves to use the same protocol, otherwise, you would get that process which you invest a lot of time in would be worthless if the others don't know.  
  
My ignorant version: "HMM that makes sense, but what the hell is TCP?"  
My wise version: "As HTTP, TCP is also a protocol. TCP is responsible to bring you or your message to the right address his response back to you... It builds the connection between client and server."  
  
But why does HTTP does not do this too?  
Divide and conquer ;) you can't be the best in everything at the same time, so let's split up the work to take out some complexity ;-)
If you break it all down, HTTP is the language that web browsers and web servers speak.


### What does a URL consist of?

To find the right one among the many servers, you have to know its exact name.  
In the computer world, URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) are used for this. As the name suggests  
the URL locates a resource, for example, a website.  

 ```
 https://examplecat.com:443/cats?color=light%20gray#banana
 \___/   \____________/\__/\___/ \________________/\_____/
   |             |       |   |           |            |
scheme          domain  port |         query       fragment id
                            path
```
<pre>
* scheme:                 used protocol
* domain:                 Host
* port:                   different services can be called on each port (Defaults 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS)
* path:                   path on the server (which directories to search for executable files)
* query parameters:       are used for different versions of a page
* URL encoding:           "%" comined with hex code '20' --> %20 --> [space]
* fragment id:            is used to jump to an specific HTML id
</pre>

# curl
Let us start with Curl.  
Curl is using Protocols to do a request to a given URL.

```bash
curl -i https://examplecat.com/cat.txt -H "Range:bytes=8-17"
```

'SO! we got the language, the connection, and the location of a site!  
We understood that a client can build a connection via TCP with the location (called URL) and talk with a Webserver a specific Language (called HTTP).  
On an abstract level, you now can understand what HTTP is good for. Let us move forward to the way how the protocol expects client and server to act'
Let us move forward to technical details.


### Anatomy of a HTTP request:

Every HTTP request and response has headers. Headers include some extra information.
On the left side of a entry is a key and the right a value:

Request:
``` HTML
<METHOD> <URI> <HTTP/version>   <- method
<Key>: <Value>                  \
...                              } headers
<anotherKey>: <anotherValue>    /

<request body>                  <- optional ( depends on what kind of request it is )
```

Response:
``` HTML
<HTTP/version> <result-code> [<message>]    <- method
<Key>: <Value>                              \
...                                          } headers
<anotherKey>: <anotherValue>                /

<response body>                             <- optional (depends on the Method of the request)
```

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

HTTPS is an extension of HTTP. It is used for secure communication of client server.
SSL and TLS (newer version of SSL) ensure that between websites cannot be read.
I save a more detailed explanation for the first one at this point, because I am running out of time and this overshoots the mark.

### Examples
Lets start with a basic cURL is a software project providing libcurl library and command-line tool curl to transfering date by using network protocols.

  
Now lets curl for some sunrise information.
```bash
curl 'https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=-21.771360&lng=-43.385880' | json_pp
```
This Latitude and Longitude infos are the location of Fulda btw. :)  
So now we are able to grep the sunrise information from anywhere.  
  


Lets do one more detailed reqeust with telnet.
Telnet is typically used for the remote control of computers in the form of text-based inputs and outputs.  
We start to establish a connection to the server and after that we are able to do our request.  
```
openssl s_client -connect portal.proemion.com:443

GET / HTTP/1.1
HOST: dataportal.proemion.com
```
